# Tempo

- I don't like typing variable names.

- We don't like to solve problems because:
  - We suck at reading
  - We don't like to read
    - Why don't we like to read?
      - Because reading leads to problems that we'll have to solve
        --> We're reading into problems
        ==> Do we need to rethink our approach to problems?
          --> Are problems our biggest problem?
            --> Are we solving problems?
            ==> Or are we just reading solutions?
