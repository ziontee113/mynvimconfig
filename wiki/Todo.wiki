# Todo:

- Streamline the Snippet Creation process
  - Automatically Import into the respective snippet table when a keymap is pressed.
  - Quick way to mark locations and jump to them

- Make a plugin that let the user open a small buffer (using something like telescope), to pick the lines from the buffer, then paste those lines to the current cursor position.
 -> Maybe utilizing Telescope is the answer.

- Make a plugin that let plugin authors to easilty show help, info, keymaps, features, etc..

- Make snippet(s) that generates OOP tests / boilerplate for learning / implementing Object Oriented Programming
