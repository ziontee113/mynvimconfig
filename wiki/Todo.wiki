# Todo:

Do we use diagrams here?
  --> We must

-> We can have commands or keymaps to change the table of choices for the <A-l> key.

- How can we utilize <A-l> when not having a choice snippet node?
  --> We can use <A-l> to "trigger a special function"
  ==> This is my draft:
    - First of all, when we <A-l> when there is no choice node, we should
      create a new choice node (with a function invoked with <A-l>)
    -> The function will trigger, creating a choiceNode.
    -> Then, we can use <A-l> to select different options of the choiceNode.
    -> Then we can jump ahead, proceed to the next node.

  - The <A-l> function will trigger a snippet.
  - We keymap the <A-l> in the snippets/ file.
  - The <A-l> function will trigger a set of user-defined snippets as choices.

- Hot snippet for <CR> purpose
--> Multiple hot snippets in 1 basket.
==> How can we make the snippet creation process even faster?
  --> Maybe something like a "snippet basket" where we can store the snippets
      and then we can create the snippet from the basket.
  --> Maybe something like a snippet that takes in the current selection, disect it with Treesitter, then we can decide which part to place a placeholder.
