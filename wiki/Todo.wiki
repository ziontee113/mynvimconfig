# Todo:

- Hot snippet for <CR> purpose
--> Multiple hot snippets in 1 basket.

- Make a plugin that let the user open a small buffer (using something like telescope), to pick the lines from the buffer, then paste those lines to the current cursor position.
 -> Maybe utilizing Telescope is the answer.

- Make a plugin that let plugin authors to easilty show help, info, keymaps, features, etc..

- Make snippet(s) that generates OOP tests / boilerplate for learning / implementing Object Oriented Programming
