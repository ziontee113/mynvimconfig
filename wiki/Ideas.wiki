- pressing "l" in a Javascript file will generates a "let" variable declaration

- In Javascript snippets, we can have:
  - 'choice nodes' that can give us 'arr' or 'arr[i]'
  - 'choice nodes' with choices of '[IF Statements]'
    => So it can go like:
      if -> Expand <A-j>
      -> Cycle through choices <A-l> 
      -> for different types of IF Statements
