<bold>Hello my darling</bold>

Having UML diagrams is a good idea, but it's not the solution to my problem.

### My Problem

I have things I want to do. But I don't know how to do them. Not in a concise way. </br>
I want to be a master, but don't have the skills yet. </br>
Which means I need to learn the skills to become the master. </br>
I need to be a student, not a master, not yet.

#### A good student doesn't necessary get praised
